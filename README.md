=====

Currently, this project is a joint effort of Ismail Faizi (a.k.a. KanAfghan) and Khan Noori, both students of 
computer science at the Technical Univercity of Denmark (DTU). The motivation behind this project is to
learn the development of software of various sizes and accuire knowledge about different technologies and
tools for the development process.

At the moment, the project consists of two games packed in the same GUI. This GUI is based on Java Applet.
The games are, 1) finding Afghanistan provinces on the map 2) matching provinces with their capitals.
